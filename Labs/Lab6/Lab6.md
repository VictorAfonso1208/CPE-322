# Lab 6
## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to serve as an introduction to two new modules, node and pystache.
By following the given commands, I can observe how node receives information from a server,
and how the pystache template works.

## Node

The first step was to run hello-world.js, view the site, and refresh the page to see what the terminal would display. The result was the following:
![node hello](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab6/Lab6%20Images/node%20hello.png)
![helloworld](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab6/Lab6%20Images/helloworld.png)

I did the same for hello.js
![hello](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab6/Lab6%20Images/hello%2Cworld.png)
![node hello](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab6/Lab6%20Images/node%20hello-world.png)

Similarly, for http.js, which updated each time I refreshed the associated webpage.

![http](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab6/Lab6%20Images/node%20http.png)

Finally, I ran say_hello.py which detailed the working of pystache.

## Conclusion
This lab showcased the usage of node and pystache and how to establish communication to a web address.
