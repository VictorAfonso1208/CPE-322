# Lab 2
## Overview
This lab's purpose is to serve as an introduction to the unix commands necessary to perform basic navigations and functions using a raspberry py.
By connecting to a raspberry pi remotely and running commands in its terminal, I was able to acquire the screenshots necessary to detail my results.

### Hostname
![hostname](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab2/Lab2Images/hostname.png)
This command gives the name of the device being used. I kept it to "raspberry pi."
