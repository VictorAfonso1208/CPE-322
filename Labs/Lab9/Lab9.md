# Lab 9
## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to learn the usage of yin, yang, and uml files, and to use gimp to generate a PNG.

The first step was to install libxml2-dev and libxslt1-dev

Next, I installed pyang and ran cat intrusiondetection.yang

I then created intrusiondetection.yin and ran cat intrusiondetection.yin

I did the same for intrusiondetection.uml

I installed plantuml and ran it to create a sequence diagram.

Finally, I used gimp to generate the following png.

## Conclusion
This lab focused on learning the function of .yin, .yang, and .uml files and how I can use gimp to generate an image from a uml file.
