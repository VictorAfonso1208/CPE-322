# Lab 3
## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to serve as an introduction to python and the various commands that are built into the raspberry pi. The commands as listed in the lab are as follows:


### cd ~/ iot and cd *3
![cd](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/cd%20iot.png)

These commands take me to the cloned iot folder and then to the lesson3 folder, from which I will be pulling the various python modules mentioned in the lab.

### python3 julian.py
![julian](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/julian.png)

This command runs the julian module, which displays the calendar date based on the julian calendar.

### python3 date_example.py
![date](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/date.png)

This command runs the date_example module, which displays the current date and its relativity to the start and end of the semester.

### python3 datetime_example.py
![datetime](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/datetime.png)

This command runs the datetime_example module, which displays the current date and time. Note that its deprecated.

### python3 time_example.py
![time](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/time.png)

This command runs the time_example module, which displays the current time every 10 seconds until interrupted.

### python3 sun.py "New York"
![sun](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/sun.png)

This command runs the sun module, that dsiplays all the times for various stages of the sun (rise, set, etc.) as viewed from New York.

### python3 moon.py
![moon](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/moon.png)

This command runs the moon module, which displays when each phase of the moon will occur relative to today.

### python3 coordinates.py "Samuel C. Williams Library"
![coord](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/coords.png)

This command runs the coordinates module, which displays the location coordinates of the school library.

### python3 address.py "40.74480675, -74.02532861159351"
![address](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/address.png)

This command runs the address module, which gives the address of the given coordinates, that being of the school.

### python3 cpu.py
![cpu](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/cpu.png)

This command runs the CPU module, which shows my device's cpu's core usage, updated by the second.

### python3 battery.py
![battery](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/battery.png)

This command runs the battery module, which displays my device's battery percentage.

### python3 documentstats.py document.txt
![document](https://github.com/VictorAfonso1208/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab3/Images/document.png)

This command runs the documentstats module, which reads the associated document text file and gives a list of the most used words and how often they appear.

## Conclusion

The purpose of this lab was to familiarize oneself with various types of python modules and how to run python commands in the terminal.
